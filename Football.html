<font size="4" color="blue" face="Times New Roman"> Chelsea FC
<font size="4" color="white" face="Times New Roman">'s 2022-2023 season has been a really bad downfall season for the club and its fans.
At the beginning of the season, after a few defeats with the german manager Thomas tuchel, the club has sacked him and got him out of the club.
They brought an unexperienced english manager Graham Potter to a big ,historical club like
<font size="4" color="blue" face="Times New Roman"> Chelsea FC
<font size="4" color="white" face="Times New Roman"> to make things better for the club and the fans. After a decent start with G.Potter,
they had a good run in the group stages of UCL by winning against the Italian giant
<font size="4" color="red" face="Times New Roman"> AC Milan
<font size="4" color="white" face="Times New Roman"> in stamford bridge 3-0, and a great 2-0 victory against them in Milan. The fans were
starting to like the new manager, and gave him the nickname "Harry Potter" which simbolizes his magical wins against big teams.
Or that was what they thought... The team only scored 1 goal February, which led to
<font size="4" color="blue" face="Times New Roman"> Chelsea FC
<font size="4" color="white" face="Times New Roman"> descending to the 10th place of the premier league. After an awful 2-0 loss against
<font size="4" color="Yellow" face="Times New Roman"> Aston
<font size="4" color="Red" face="Times New Roman"> Villa
<font size="4" color="white" face="Times New Roman"> The club immidiately got Potter out of the club. The club is currently in the 11th place
of the premier league. They brought back the previous
<font size="4" color="blue" face="Times New Roman"> Chelsea FC
<font size="4" color="white" face="Times New Roman"> manager Frank Lampard back to business. He didn't even play his first game with the team though,
but he didn't have many achievements as the 2017 manager either. The club currently waiting for the game against
<font size="4" color="Orange" face="Times New Roman">Wolverhampton FC
<font size="4" color="white" face="Times New Roman"> on April 8. We are wishing the best for the team.
